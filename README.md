# Bot VK 
## Bot to select a topic for debate.
## Ver.1:
   - You can choose only the complexity of the topic.
## Ver.2:
##### You can choose: 
   -  a random topic, 
   -  language, 
   -  complexity,
   -  scope of discussion
   -  format of the topic

#### To start the bot, run the main.py file.
#### The token is located in the public / group "Settings" -> "Work with API" -> "Access keys". 
#### You must also enable the Long Poll API ["Settings" -> "Work with API" -> "Long Poll API"](I used version 5.103)
#### For the "start" button to appear, go to the public / group settings -> messages -> settings for the bot - enable.
